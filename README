Installation Notes:
After checking out the source, run 'php bin/vendors install' to install the 
libraries used by Symfony.

The app/cache and app/logs directories must be writable both by the web server 
and the command line user. Either:
 rm -rf app/cache/*
 rm -rf app/logs/*
 sudo chmod +a "www-data allow delete,write,append,file_inherit,directory_inherit" app/cache app/logs
 sudo chmod +a "yourname allow delete,write,append,file_inherit,directory_inherit" app/cache app/logs
Or:
 sudo setfacl -R -m u:www-data:rwx -m u:yourname:rwx app/cache app/logs
 sudo setfacl -dR -m u:www-data:rwx -m u:yourname:rwx app/cache app/logs

The code is set up to be used behind a reverse caching proxy (like Varnish), 
but the built-in Symfony cache (written in PHP) can be used instead.
See <http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/http_cache.html> for details.

Access to app_dev.php and config.php should be denied.
