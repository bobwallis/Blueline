Build using the ./build script and install into the MySQL plugin folder as
guided, then import the install.sql file (you'll need root access to do this).

Building uses GCC, and the MySQL development libraries.
I tend to use PostgreSQL now, so this isn't well-tested in recent versions of
MySQL. It isn't the most complicated code though, so probably won't break
unless there are some breaking API changes on MySQL's side.
